This game runs off a proprietary engine created by Bill Appleton at CyberFlix called DreamFactory.

Because of the proprietary nature of the engine, *pre-existing* information is hard to come by.

Any information that I can pull from elsewhere, I will add to my reverse engineering guide 
(with proper attribution given, of course) - as whatever sraps that CAN be found will be helpful not
just in creating tools, but creating new avenues to change up the game, as well as provide a good
starting point for figuring out more about how the game works.
